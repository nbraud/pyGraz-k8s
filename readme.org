* initial setup
** setup shell, cluster, dependencies
- =nix develop= to have the necessary tools
- =kind create cluster --config kind-config.yaml=
- pre-load some necessary container images: Cilium for networking, and the Hickory DNS server:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  for img in quay.io/cilium/cilium:v1.17.2 docker.io/hickorydns/hickory-dns:latest docker.io/busybox:latest quay.io/appzygy/ociregistry:1.8.2; do
      docker pull $img
      kind load docker-image $img
  done
#+END_SRC
- download cilium's helm chart with =helm pull cilium --version 1.17.2 --repo https://helm.cilium.io/=
  this is a workaround for something I haven't debugged yet

** setup pulumi for new project
- =pulumi login --local= to make Pulumi store its state locally
  a production environment would have remote state, to coordinate between multiple administrators
- ~~=pulumi new kubernetes-python=~~ would be needed if this was a new project
- =pulumi install= to install dependencies

* deploy base config
- start =cloud-provider-kind= in the background
- get control plane endpoint via =kubectl get endpoints kubernetes=
  set it in the stack's config with =pulumi config set k8sEndpoint $endpoint=
- =pulumi up=
- check =cilium status= and =kubectl get pods -o wide --all-namespaces=
